	p.text-justify
		|Categorization of instances in dataspaces is a difficult and time consuming task, usually performed by domain experts. I proposed a semi-automatic approach to the extraction of facets for the fine-grained categorization of instances in dataspaces. The approach leverages Taxonomy Layer Distance, a new metric based on structural analysis of source taxonomies, to support the identification of meaningful candidate facets. Once validated and refined by domain experts, the extracted facets provide a fine-grained classification of dataspace instances. I implemented and evaluated the approach in a real world dataspace in the eCommerce domain.
